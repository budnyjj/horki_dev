About
-----
Mobile Navigation helps us easily implement a nice solution for displaying 
menus on the mobile version of a responsive website. However now in version 2,
multiple displays can be defined, allowing Mobile Navigation to have 
transformed versions of menus even on the wider widths. This also allows us
tu have multiple configurations on diferent displays for one same menu.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------
1. Download and extract the Mobile Navigation Module into the modules directory.
2. Go to /admin/config/user-interface/mobile_navigation.
   Configure the displays (or breakpoints), as many as you need.
3. Go to the Mobile Navigation Tab at the admin Drupal configuration for the 
   menu you want to transform, that is at 
   /admin/structure/menu/manage/<Menu you want to configure>
   There you have to add a new display for the corresponding menu.
   You can only add one configuration on each menu, for each defined display.
4. Once you have added a display to the menu, go to "Edit Configuration".
   (At this point a Mobile Navigation version of the menu should be showing up
   at the corresponding configured display).
5. There you will find all settings for configurating a mobile navigation
   instance.



Enjoy!
